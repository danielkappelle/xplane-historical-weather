    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>February 9th, 2020, hurricane Ciara put me in quite a shake as my plane from Spain landed at Schiphol airport. I
      wanted to be able to attempt that landing in X-Plane 11 with the same weather, so I needed a way to get the
      weather in. I found that there was no proper way to do it, although I did find the website from <em>Iowa State
        University</em> which had historical METAR files.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, this tool helps you flying in historical weather! Happy flying âœˆ</p>
